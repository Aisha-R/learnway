Python/Django backend for helping users retain information long-term by prompting them to review said information periodically. The intervals implemented in this application are based on the information on this site 'https://www.edapp.com/blog/how-spaced-repetition-works/'.

## Installation

Carry out the following instructions (if you don't already have them configured):

1. Install an IDE (I have Visual Studio Code from 'https://code.visualstudio.com/')
2. Install Python (from 'https://www.python.org/downloads/')
3. Set up (and activate) a virtual environment and install Django within it (according to the instructions on 'https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/howto/windows/').
4. Set the python interpreter to the 'python.exe' file within the Scripts folder
5. Fork this repository inside the virtual environment.
6. Finally, run the following inside the terminal:
   ```python
    py manage.py runserver
   ```
